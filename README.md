# **Brokkr**
>In Norse mythology the dwarf Brokkr ("the one who works with metal fragments; blacksmith") is brother to Eitri (or Sindri). He assisted with the creation of Gullinbursti (Golden Boar), Draupnir (Golden Ring), and most widely known Mjölnir (Thor's Hammer) by manning the bellows to his brothers magical forge. Unfornately Loki had other plans and though he failed to effect the creation of Gullinbursti & Draupnir but caused Brokkr to momentarily faulter with the bellows whilst Mjölnir was being forged. Thus led to the shortened handle of the hammer. Ultilmately the two brothers wired Loki's mouth shut for his interference.

Brokkr is a discord bot created to to act as a quick refrence for the popular game [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) which is available free for download.
