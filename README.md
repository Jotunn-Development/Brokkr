# **Brokkr**
>In Norse mythology the dwarf Brokkr ("the one who works with metal fragments; blacksmith") is brother to Eitri (or Sindri). He assisted with the creation of Gullinbursti (Golden Boar), Draupnir (Golden Ring), and most widely known Mjölnir (Thor's Hammer) by manning the bellows to his brothers magical forge. Unfornately Loki had other plans and though he failed to effect the creation of Gullinbursti & Draupnir but caused Brokkr to momentarily faulter with the bellows whilst Mjölnir was being forged. Thus led to the shortened handle of the hammer. Ultilmately the two brothers wired Loki's mouth shut for his interference.

Brokkr is a discord bot created to to act as a quick refrence for the popular game [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) which is available free for download.

## Features
Features for Brokkr are still being fleshed out at this time. Below is a small idea of what would hopefully be included.

* Skill descriptions and what they do
* Material descriptions
* General help in which key presses to use
* Much more

## Server Setup

Invite [Brokkr](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize/?permissions=387136&scope=bot&client_id=767593088108724244) to your server. The bot is preconfigured with the messaging permissions it will require to function on your server. From there you will be able to create a custom prefix via `b.prefix <prefix>`. Running `b.help` will give you a list of commands available from Brokkr for you to use.
